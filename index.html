    <h1>Gottacelli Botticelli</h1>
    <h3>by Elon Rov</h3>
    <div class="main">
      <div class="characters-1">
        <div  class="mercury"><img src="src/images/figures/mercury.png" height="150px">
          <p>On the far left is Mercury, readily identifiable by his prominent winged sandals. He uses his staff to clear the clouds
          from the sky and help Venus usher in the Spring. Mercury may have been modeled after Lorenzo de' Medici, who
          commissioned the painting.
            </p></div>
        <div class="graces"><img src="src/images/figures/graces.png" height="150px">
          <p>The Three Graces, a group of three sisters draped in diaphanous white, join hands in a dance. The graces are named
          Pleasure, Chastity and Beauty, representing the pillars of ideal love. Ironically, it is Chastity who gazes longingly at Mercury, unaware of 
          Cupid's arrow pointed right at her. 
            </p></div>
        <div class="venus"><img src="src/images/figures/venus.png" height="150px">
          <p>In the center is the Roman goddess, Venus. She is depicted with her head tilted and gesturing to her right, her eyes
          meeting the viewerâ€™s. Above her is her son, Cupid, and behind him the tree limbs form an arch which frame Venus and
          provide her with a privileged position in the painting. She presides over the blooming orange grove and brings forth
          growth, fertility, and prosperity.

      <div class="characters-2">
        <div class="flora"><img src="src/images/figures/flora.png" height="150px">
          <p>Flora is the goddess of spring, particularly of May flowers, and is depicted here as the personification of springtime.
          There are at least 500 identified plant species depicted in the painting, with about 190 different flowers, of which at
          least 130 can be specifically identified.
            </p></div>
        <div class="chloris"><img src="src/images/figures/chloris.png" height="150px">
          <p>After marrying Zephyrus, Chloris the nymph transforms into Flora, the goddess of spring, flowers, and new growth. She is
          depicted here with roses spilling out of her lips as she breathes. She is said to have been responsible for the
          transformations of Adonis, Attis, Crocus, Hyacinthus and Narcissus into flowers.
            </p></div>
        <div class="zephyrus"><img src="src/images/figures/zephyrus.png" height="150px">
          <p>On the far right is Zephyrus, representing the biting winds of March, the first of the spring winds. Above him, the
          trees are bare and dark. After fighting with his brother over the nymph Chloris, Zephyrus kidnaps and possesses her. In
          remorse, he later transforms her into a deity, giving her the domain of flowers.
