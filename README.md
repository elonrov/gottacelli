# Gottacelli Botticelli

Gottacelli Botticelli is a game based on the painting "Primavera" by Sandro Botticelli. Fly cupid around the orange grove, avoiding the lingering winter clouds, being careful not to touch the ground, and catching as many falling oranges as possible. While Mercury fails to protect Flora from the winter chill, Cupid must help her make the most of the last days of spring.

Arrow keys to move, Enter to start, M to mute.  

Gottacelli was built using JavaScript's CanvasJS charting library.
